 <p><h4>Foreword</h4></p>


 <p>It is a significant fact that nearly all Ford cars are driven by<br>
 laymen--by owners, who in the great majority of cases have little<br>
 or no practical experience with things mechanical.</p>
<p>
 The simplicity of the Ford car and the ease with which it<br>
 is operated renders an intimate knowledge of mechanical<br>
 technicalities unnecessary for its operation.</p>

 <p>And the further fact that there are more than twenty thousand Ford<br>
 service stations distributed throughout the civilized world--where<br>
 adjustments and repairs may be had with no annoying delay--gives<br>
 to Ford owners a singular freedom from mechanical annoyances<br>
 which beset owners of cars having limited service facilities and<br>
 distribution.</p>

 <p>But while it is not imperative, it is, however, altogether<br>
 desirable that every Ford owner should thoroughly understand his<br>
 car. With such knowledge at his command he is always master of the<br>
 situation--he will maintain his car more economically--prolong its<br>
 usefulness--and he will also derive more pleasure from it, for it<br>
 is a truism that the more one knows about a thing the more one
 enjoys it.</p>

 <p>The mastery of a thorough knowledge of Ford construction is by no<br>
 means a difficult or time-consuming task. The Ford is the simplest<br>
 car made. It is easy to understand, and is not difficult to keep<br>
 in proper adjustment and repair.</p>

 <p>That the Ford construction may be thoroughly understood--and<br>
 that there may be an authoritative guide for the making of Ford<br>
 adjustments--this book is published.</p>


 <p><strong>Important</strong></p>

 <p>_It is most important that owners of Ford cars shall insist upon<br>
 getting the genuine Ford-made materials, or "Parts," when having<br>
 repairs or replacements made. This will be assured when the car<br>
 is taken to the authorized Ford agent. Imitation, or "bogus" or<br>
 counterfeit parts of inferior quality are being made and sold as<br>
 "Ford Parts." Avoid their use by dealing with the authorised Ford<br>
 agent._</p>




 <p><h4>The Car and Its Operation</h4></p>


 <p>_What must be done before starting the Car?_         _Answer No. 1_</p>

 <p>Before trying to start the car, fill the radiator (by removing cap<br>
 at top) with clean fresh water. If perfectly clean water cannot<br>
 be obtained it is advisable to strain it through muslin or other<br>
 similar material to prevent foreign matter from getting in and<br>
 obstructing the small tubes of the radiator. The system will hold<br>
 approximately three gallons. It is important that the car should<br>
 not be run under its own power unless the water circulating system<br>
 has been filled. Pour in the water until you are sure that both<br>
 radiator and cylinder water jackets are full. The water will run<br>
 out of the overflow pipe onto the ground when the entire water<br>
 system has been properly filled. During the first few days that a<br>
 new car is being driven it is a good plan to examine the radiator<br>
 frequently and see that it is kept properly filled. The water<br>
 supply should be replenished as often as may be found necessary.<br>
 Soft rain water, when it is to be had in a clean state, is<br>
 superior to hard water, which may contain alkalies and other salts<br>
 which tend to deposit sediment and clog the radiator. (See chapter<br>
 on Cooling System.)</p>


 <p>_What about Gasoline?_                               _Answer No. 2_</p>

 <p>The ten-gallon gasoline tank should be filled--nearly full--and<br>
 the supply should never be allowed to get low. When filling the<br>
 tank be sure that there are no naked flames within several feet,<br>
 as the vapor is extremely volatile and travels rapidly. Always<br>
 be careful about lighting matches near where gasoline has been<br>
 spilled, as the air within a radius of several feet is permeated<br>
 with the highly explosive vapor. The small vent hole in the<br>
 gasoline tank cap should not be allowed to get plugged up, as<br>
 this would prevent proper flow of the gasoline to the carburetor.<br>
 The gasoline tank may be drained by opening the pet cock in the<br>
 sediment bulb at the bottom.</p>


<p> _How about the Oiling System?_                      _Answer No. 3_</p>

 <p>Upon receipt of the car see that a supply of medium light,<br>
 high-grade gas engine oil is poured into the crank case through<br>
 the breather pipe at the front of the engine (a metal cap covers<br>
 it). Down under the car in the flywheel casing (the reservoir<br>
 which holds this oil) you will find two pet cocks. Pour oil in<br>
 slowly until it runs out of the upper cock. Leave the cock open<br>
 until it stops running--then close it. After the engine has<br>
 become thoroughly limbered up, the best results will be obtained<br>
 by carrying the oil at a level midway between the two cocks--but<br>
 under no circumstances should it be allowed to get below the lower<br>
 cock. All other parts of the car are properly oiled when it leaves<br>
 the factory. However, it will be well to see that all grease cups<br>
 are filled and that oil is supplied to necessary parts. (See Cut<br>
 No. 18, also chapter on Lubrication.)</p>


<p> _How are Spark and Throttle Levers used?_           _Answer No. 4_</p>

<p>Under the steering wheel are two small levers. The right-hand<br>
(throttle) lever controls the amount of mixture (gasoline and air)<br>
which goes into the engine. When the engine is in operation, the<br>
farther this lever is moved downward toward the driver (referred<br>
to as "opening the throttle") the faster the engine runs and the<br>
greater the power furnished. The left-hand lever controls the<br>
spark, which explodes the gas in the cylinders of the engine. The<br>
advancing of this lever "advances the spark," and it should<br>
be moved down notch by notch until the motor seems to reach its<br>
maximum speed. If the lever is advanced beyond this point a dull<br>
knock will be noticed in the engine. (See chapter on Ignition.)</p>

 <p>[Illustration: Steering Wheel, showing reduction gears meshing<br>
 with the teeth of the gear case and center pinion. (Cut No. 1)]</p>


 <p>_Where should these levers be when starting the Engine?_
                                                      _Answer No. 5_</p>

 <p>The spark lever should usually be put in about the third or fourth<br>
 notch of the quadrant (the notched half-circle on which the levers<br>
 operate). The throttle should usually be opened about five or<br>
 six notches. A little experience will soon teach you where these<br>
 levers should be placed for proper starting. Care should be taken<br>
 not to advance the spark lever too far, as the engine may "back<br>
 kick."</p>


<p> _What else is necessary before starting the Engine?_ _Answer No. 6_</p>

 <p>First, see that the hand lever, which comes up through the floor<br>
 of the car at the left of the driver, is pulled back as far as it<br>
 will go. The lever in this position holds the clutch in neutral<br>
 and engages the hub brake, thus preventing the car moving forward<br>
 when the engine is started. Second, after inserting the switch key<br>
 in the switch on the coil box, throw the switch lever as far to<br>
 the left as it will go--to the point marked "magneto." This switch<br>
 connects the magneto with the engine. The engine can't be started<br>
 until it is on--and the throwing off of this switch stops the<br>
 engine.</p>


 <p>_How is the Engine started?_                         _Answer No. 7_</p>

 <p>If the car is not equipped with a starter the engine is started<br>
 by the lifting of the starting crank at the front of the car.<br>
 Take hold of the handle and push firmly toward the car till you<br>
 feel the crank ratchet engage, then lift upward with a quick<br>
 swing. With a little experience this operation wall become an<br>
 easy matter. Don't, as a usual thing, crank downward against the<br>
 compression--for then an early explosion may drive the handle<br>
 vigorously backward. This does not mean however, that it is not<br>
 advisable, when the car is hard to start, to occasionally "spin"<br>
 the engine by the use of the starting handle--but be sure the<br>
 spark lever is retarded when spinning or cranking the engine<br>
 against compression, otherwise a sudden backfire may injure the<br>
 arm of the operator. When the engine is cool it is advisable to<br>
 prime the carburetor by pulling on the small wire at the lower<br>
 left corner of the radiator while giving the engine two or three<br>
 quarter turns with the starting handle.</p>

 <p>If the car is equipped with a starter the spark and throttle<br>
 levers should be placed in the same position on the quadrant as<br>
 when cranking by hand, and the ignition switch turned on. Current<br>
 from either battery or magneto may be used for ignition. However,<br>
 we recommend that the magneto be used at all times. The magneto<br>
 was designed to furnish ignition for the Model T engine and<br>
 better results will be obtained by operating in this way. Special<br>
 attention must be paid to the position of the spark lever as a<br>
 too advanced spark will cause serious backfiring which in turn<br>
 will bend or break the shaft in the starter. The starting motor is<br>
 operated by a push button, conveniently located in the floor of<br>
 the car at the driver's feet. With the spark and throttle levers<br>
 in the proper position, and the ignition switch turned on, press<br>
 on the push button with the foot. This closes the circuit between<br>
 the battery and starting motor, causing the pinion of the Bendix<br>
 drive shaft to engage with the teeth on the flywheel, thus turning<br>
 over the crankshaft. When the engine is cold it may be necessary<br>
 to prime it by pulling out the carburetor priming rod, which is<br>
 located on the instrument board. In order to avoid flooding the<br>
 engine with an over rich mixture of gas, the priming rod should<br>
 only be held out for a few seconds at a time.</p>


 <p>_How is the Engine best started in cold weather?_    _Answer No. 8_</p>

 <p>As gasoline does not vaporize readily in cold weather it is<br>
 naturally more difficult to start the motor under such conditions.<br>
 The usual method of starting the engine when cold is to turn<br>
 the carburetor dash adjustment one-quarter turn to the left in<br>
 order to allow a richer mixture of gasoline to be drawn into the<br>
 cylinders; then hold out the priming rod, while you turn crank<br>
 from six to eight one-quarter turns in quick succession, or turn<br>
 the motor over a few times with the starter. Another method of<br>
 starting a troublesome cold engine is as follows: Before you throw<br>
 on the magneto switch, (1) close throttle lever; (2) hold out<br>
 priming rod while you give crank several quick turns, or turn the<br>
 motor over a few times with the starter, then let go of priming<br>
 rod (being careful that it goes back all the way); (3) place spark<br>
 lever in about third notch and advance throttle lever several<br>
 notches; (4) throw on switch (being sure to get it on side marked<br>
 "Magneto"); (5) give crank one or two turns, or close the starting<br>
 switch, and the motor should start. After starting the motor it<br>
 is advisable to advance the spark eight or ten notches on the<br>
 quadrant and let the motor run until thoroughly heated up. If you<br>
 start out with a cold motor you will not have much power and are<br>
 liable to "stall." The advantage of turning on the switch last, or<br>
 after priming, is that when you throw on the switch and start the<br>
 motor, you have plenty of gas in the cylinders, to keep the motor<br>
 running, thereby eliminating the trouble of the motor starting and<br>
 stopping. After motor is warmed up turn carburetor adjustment back<br>
 one-quarter turn.</p>

 <p>To facilitate starting many drivers make a practice of stopping<br>
 their engine by pulling out on the priming rod, which has the<br>
 effect of shutting off the air suction and filling the cylinders<br>
 full of a very rich gasoline vapor. This should not be done unless<br>
 the car is going to stand over night or long enough to cool off.<br>
 If the motor is stopped in this way and then started when hot,<br>
 starting is apt to be difficult on account of the surplus gasoline<br>
 in the carburetor.</p>
